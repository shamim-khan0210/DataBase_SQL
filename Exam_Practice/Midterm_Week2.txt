regions:(region_id, region_name)

1. Selecting specific columns
Write SQL statement to find employee id, last name, first name and phone number of all employees.

Select employee_id, last_name, job_id, department_id, salary
from employees
where department_id = 50 and salary >= 5000 order by salary desc;



Practice: 1.1
Write SQL statement to find location id, street and city.

select location_id, street, city
from employee;



Practice: 1.2
Write SQL statement to find department id, manager id, employee id and salary.

select department_id, manager_id, employee_id, salary
from employees;


2. Arithmetic operations in columns
Write SQL statement to find employee id, first name, last name and monthly salary.

Select employee_id, first_name, last_name
from employees
where first_name like '%st%' or last_name like '%t%';


Practice: 2.1
Write SQL statement to find employee id and 5 years salary.

select employee_id, (monthly_salary*60)
from employee;


Practice: 2.2
Write SQL statement to find the job id and the sum of min_salary and max_salary.

select job_id, min_salary, max_salary
from employee;


3. Defining column alias
Write SQL statement to find id first name, last name and salary/12 as ‘Monthly Salary’

select employee_id, first_name, salary
from employees
where salary between 5000 and 10000
order by salary desc, first_name asc;



4. Using concatenation operation
Write SQL statement to find employee id, concatenation of first name and last name and a space between first name and last name and show column header as name.

SELECT DISTINCT job_id, salary
FROM employees;


5. Find the (concatenated first name and last name with a space between them) as name
Find the (concatenated first name and last name with a space between them) as name, phone number and job id of all employees whose job id field containing the word 'CLERK'. Hint: use INSTR function. If the string is present in the value, it will return the numeric position of the string, otherwise it will return 0

select employee_id, first_name, job_id, hire_date
from employees
where job_id = 'IT_PROG' and hire_date > '2006-01-01';


6. Multiple conditions and the use of length function
Find the (concatenated first name and last name with a space between them) as name, length of first name, email, hire date and job id of all employees whose job id field containing the word 'CLERK' and length of first name is minimum 5 and hire date earlier than '2004-01-01'

Select employee_id, salary, commission_pct, manager_id
from employees
where commission_pct is not null or manager_id is not null;



7. Sorting of data
Find first name, last name, hire date for all employees whose hire date is earlier than 1st January 2003. Show the result in ascending order of hire date

select e.employee_id, j.job_id, j.job_title, j.min_salary
from employees e join jobs j on j.job_id = e.job_id
where e.department_id = 60;



8. Multiple conditions and the use of length function
Find the (concatenated first name and last name with a space between them) as name, length of first name, email, hire date and job id of all employees whose job id field containing the word 'CLERK' and length of first name is minimum 5 and hire date earlier than '2004-01-01'

SELECT r.region_name, c.country_name, l.location_id, l.city
FROM regions r
JOIN countries c ON r.region_id = c.region_id
JOIN locations l ON c.country_id = l.country_id
WHERE r.region_id = 3;
